## 📖 Getting Started

> **Note** Rose b1.7.3 requires **JDK 17**. If you encounter any resolution issues, I recommend using the [**Temurin JDK**](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=windows&arch=x64&package=jre&version=17).

> 💡 **Need Babric for Beta 1.7.3?** Follow the [Babric setup guide](https://github.com/babric/prism-instance) to get started.

> **Suggestion? Bug?** Join our Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/4xJ4XQYHZJ).

Gitea actions aren't set up on here and I don't feel like setting them up so you're gonna have to build this yourself.

1. Set up a Babric instance.
2. Clone this repository with ``git clone https://git.nathatpas.tel/skibidiware/rose-babric.git``, or download and extract the [source code](https://git.nathatpas.tel/skibidiware/rose-babric/archive/master.zip).
3. Open a terminal in the `rose-babric` folder and run `./gradlew build`, then wait for it to finish
4. Look for the `.jar` in the new `build/libs` folder and add it to your fabric mods.
